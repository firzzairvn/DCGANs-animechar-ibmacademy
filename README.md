# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks

This program will discuss Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks from IBM Academy learning which will consist of several exercises. In order to generate anime character images taken from the cartoon_20000 dataset model, it will utilize Tensorflow technology through KERAS to assist in the training and visualization of anime character images.
